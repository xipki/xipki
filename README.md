## Get Started

### JAVA_HOME
  Set the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the root directory of JRE/JDK installation.

### Binaries

Download the binaries `xipki-ca-<version>.zip`, `xipki-ocsp-<version>.zip`, 
`xipki-gateway-<version>.zip`, `xipki-mgmt-cli-<version>.tar.gz`, `xipki-cli-<version>.tar.gz`
from [releases](https://github.com/xipki/xipki/releases).

Only if you want to use the development version, build it from source code as
follows.

- Get a copy of project code, e.g.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/xipki/xipki
  ```
- Build the project

  In folder `xipki`
  ```sh
  mvn clean install -DskipTests
  ```
 
  Then you will find the following binaries:
   - DB Tool: `assemblies/xipki-dbtool/target/xipki-dbtool-<version>.zip`
   - CA: `assemblies/xipki-ca/target/xipki-ca-<version>.zip`
   - OCSP: `assemblies/xipki-ocsp/target/xipki-ocsp-<version>.zip`
   - Protocol Gateway (CMP, SCEP, EST, REST): `assemblies/xipki-gateway/target/xipki-gateway-<version>.zip`
   - Management CLI: `assemblies/xipki-mgmt-cli/target/xipki-mgmt-cli-<version>.tar.gz`
   - CLI: `assemblies/xipki-cli/target/xipki-cli-<version>.tar.gz`

## Install DB Tool

JDK 8+ is required.

1. Unpack the binary `xipki-dbtool-<version>.zip`.
2. If you use database other than PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL, you need to get the JDBC driver and
   copy it to the directory `lib/jdbc`.
 
## Install CA Server

JDK 8+ is required.

**Note that all keys and certificates in the delivery are only for demo purpose. In production environment
they MUST be replaced.**

1. Unpack tomcat to a new folder
2. Unpack the binary `xipki-ca-<version>.zip` and install CA as described in the
   unpacked README file.

## Install OCSP Responder

JDK 8+ is required.

**Note that all keys and certificates in the delivery are only for demo purpose. In production environment
they MUST be replaced.**

1. Unpack tomcat to a new folder
2. Unpack the binary `xipki-ocsp-<version>.zip` and install OCSP responder as described in the
   unpacked README file.

## Install Protocol Gateway

JDK 8+ is required.

**Note that all keys and certificates in the delivery are only for demo purpose. In production environment
they MUST be replaced.**

1. Unpack tomcat to a new folder
2. Unpack the binary `xipki-gate-<version>.zip` and install protocol gateway as described in the
   unpacked README file.

## Install Management Command Line Interface

JDK 11+ is required.

**Note that all keys and certificates in the delivery are only for demo purpose. In production environment
they MUST be replaced.**

1. Unpack the binary `xipki-mgmt-cli-<version>.tar.gz`
2. If you get "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: &lt;jdbc class&gt;", please copy the missing JDBC driver jar to the directory `lib/boot`.

## Install Command Line Interface

JDK 11+ is required.

**Note that all keys and certificates in the delivery are only for demo purpose. In production environment
they MUST be replaced.**

1. Unpack the binary `xipki-cli-<version>.tar.gz`

## Configure PKCS#11 device (optional)

   This step is only required if the real PKCS#11 device instead of the emulator
   is used. **Note that this step should be applied to all components tomcat, xipki-mgmt-cli, and xipki-cli**.

  * Copy `xipki/security/example/pkcs11-hsm.json` to `xipki/security/pkcs11.json`, and adapt the PKCS#11 configuration.

## Configure how to handle SSL client certificate (optional)

  This step is only required if the CA is behind a reverse proxy apache httpd.

  * Add the java property org.xipki.reverseproxy.mode
    ```sh
    -Dorg.xipki.reverseproxy.mode=APACHE
    ```

  * configure the proxy to forward the headers via mod_proxy with the following
    configuration

   ```sh
   # Require SSL Client verification
   SSLVerifyClient		require

   #initialize the special headers to a blank value to avoid http header forgeries 
   RequestHeader set SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY  "" 
   RequestHeader set SSL_CLIENT_CERT  "" 
   
   <Location / >
    RequestHeader set SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY "%{SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY}s"
    RequestHeader set SSL_CLIENT_CERT "%{SSL_CLIENT_CERT}s"
    ...
   </Location>
   ```

    * [Jetty: Tricks to do client certificate authentications behind a reverse proxy](http://www.zeitoun.net/articles/client-certificate-x509-authentication-behind-reverse-proxy/start)
    * [Apache Module mod_ssl](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#envvars)

## Setup CA Server

1. Start the servlet container  
HSM devices of Thales, e.g. nCipher, can use Thales preload to manage the
PKCS#11 sessions. In this case, the servlet container should be started as follows
```sh
preload <start script>
```

2. Setup CA in Management CLI (xipki-mgmt-cli)
    * _(If error like "Identity or Certificate with label=mylabel already exists" occurs,
      you need to comment the line which generate the key (e.g. dsa-p11 ec-p11, rsa-p11, sm2-p12)
      or delete the existing key using command `delete-key-p11`)_.

   * Start Management CLI.

     `bin/karaf`

     HSM devices of Thales, e.g. nCipher, can use Thales preload to manage the
     PKCS#11 sessions. In this case, the cli should be started as follows
     ```sh
     preload bin/karaf
     ```
 
   * Setup CA (choose p11 if the key is saved in PKCS#11 device, p12 in PKCS#12 device.
      * In case of using new keys and certificates, in CLI:  
        `source xipki/ca-setup/cacert-none/setup-*-*.script`
         where * is place holder.

      * In case of using existing keys and certificates, in CLI:  
        `source xipki/ca-setup/cacert-present/setup-*-*.script`
         where * is place holder.

      * If you wish to generate the siging key and certificate for the OCSP responder, in CLI:  
         `source xipki/ca-setup/setup-ocsp-*.script`.

      * If you wish to add the SCEP support, in CLI:  
         `source xipki/ca-setup/setup-scep.script`.

   * Verify the installation, execute the command in CLI:  
     `ca-info myca1`

## Enroll/Revoke Certificate

* EST  
  Use any EST client.

  The binary `xipki-cli-<version>`.tar.gz contains an example script in the folder xipki/client-script.
  It can be executed in the CLI as follows:
  - `source xipki/client-script/est-client.script`

* SCEP  
  Use any SCEP client. XiPKI provides also a SCEP client.

  The binary `xipki-cli-<version>`.tar.gz contains an example script in the folder xipki/client-script.
  It can be executed in the CLI as follows:  
  - `source xipki/client-script/scep-client.script`

* CMP  
  Use any CMP client. XiPKI provides also a CMP client.

  The binary `xipki-cli-<version>`.tar.gz contains an example script in the folder xipki/client-script.
  It can be executed in the CLI as follows:  
  - `source xipki/client-script/cmp-client.script` (use argument 'help' to print the usage)

* REST API  
  The shell script `xipki/client-script/rest.sh` of the `xipki-cli` demonstrates
  the use of REST API.

  The binary `xipki-cli-<version>`.tar.gz contains an example script in the folder xipki/client-script.
  It can be executed in the CLI as follows:  
  - `source xipki/client-script/rest-client.script` (use argument 'help' to print the usage)
