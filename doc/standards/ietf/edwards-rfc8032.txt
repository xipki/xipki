1.  Introduction

   The Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a variant of
   Schnorr's signature system with (possibly twisted) Edwards curves.
   EdDSA needs to be instantiated with certain parameters, and this
   document describes some recommended variants.

   To facilitate adoption of EdDSA in the Internet community, this
   document describes the signature scheme in an implementation-oriented
   way and provides sample code and test vectors.

   The advantages with EdDSA are as follows:

   1.  EdDSA provides high performance on a variety of platforms;

   2.  The use of a unique random number for each signature is not
       required;

   3.  It is more resilient to side-channel attacks;

   4.  EdDSA uses small public keys (32 or 57 bytes) and signatures (64
       or 114 bytes) for Ed25519 and Ed448, respectively;

   5.  The formulas are "complete", i.e., they are valid for all points
       on the curve, with no exceptions.  This obviates the need for
       EdDSA to perform expensive point validation on untrusted public
       values; and

   6.  EdDSA provides collision resilience, meaning that hash-function
       collisions do not break this system (only holds for PureEdDSA).

   The original EdDSA paper [EDDSA] and the generalized version
   described in "EdDSA for more curves" [EDDSA2] provide further
   background.  RFC 7748 [RFC7748] discusses specific curves, including
   Curve25519 [CURVE25519] and Ed448-Goldilocks [ED448].

   Ed25519 is intended to operate at around the 128-bit security level
   and Ed448 at around the 224-bit security level.  A sufficiently large
   quantum computer would be able to break both.  Reasonable projections
   of the abilities of classical computers conclude that Ed25519 is
   perfectly safe.  Ed448 is provided for those applications with
   relaxed performance requirements and where there is a desire to hedge
   against analytical attacks on elliptic curves.

   p              Denotes the prime number defining the underlying field

   GF(p)          Finite field with p elements

   x^y            x multiplied by itself y times

   B              Generator of the group or subgroup of interest

   h_i            The i'th bit of h

   a || b         (bit-)string a concatenated with (bit-)string b

   a <= b         a is less than or equal to b

   a >= b         a is greater than or equal to b

   SHAKE256(x, y) The y first octets of SHAKE256 [FIPS202] output for
                  input x

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   dom2(x, y)     The blank octet string when signing or verifying
                  Ed25519.  Otherwise, the octet string: "SigEd25519 no
                  Ed25519 collisions" || octet(x) || octet(OLEN(y)) ||
                  y, where x is in range 0-255 and y is an octet string
                  of at most 255 octets.  "SigEd25519 no Ed25519
                  collisions" is in ASCII (32 octets).

   dom4(x, y)     The octet string "SigEd448" || octet(x) ||
                  octet(OLEN(y)) || y, where x is in range 0-255 and y
                  is an octet string of at most 255 octets.  "SigEd448"
                  is in ASCII (8 octets).

   Parentheses (i.e., '(' and ')') are used to group expressions, in
   order to avoid having the description depend on a binding order
   between operators.

   Bit strings are converted to octet strings by taking bits from left
   to right, packing those from the least significant bit of each octet
   to the most significant bit, and moving to the next octet when each
   octet fills up.  The conversion from octet string to bit string is
   the reverse of this process; for example, the 16-bit bit string

             b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15

   is converted into two octets x0 and x1 (in this order) as

             x0 = b7*128+b6*64+b5*32+b4*16+b3*8+b2*4+b1*2+b0
             x1 = b15*128+b14*64+b13*32+b12*16+b11*8+b10*4+b9*2+b8

   Little-endian encoding into bits places bits from left to right and
   from least significant to most significant.  If combined with
   bit-string-to-octet-string conversion defined above, this results in
   little-endian encoding into octets (if length is not a multiple of 8,
   the most significant bits of the last octet remain unused).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  EdDSA Algorithm

   EdDSA is a digital signature system with 11 parameters.

   The generic EdDSA digital signature system with its 11 input
   parameters is not intended to be implemented directly.  Choosing
   parameters is critical for secure and efficient operation.  Instead,
   you would implement a particular parameter choice for EdDSA (such as




Josefsson & Liusvaara         Informational                     [Page 5]

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   Ed25519 or Ed448), sometimes slightly generalized to achieve code
   reuse to cover Ed25519 and Ed448.

   Therefore, a precise explanation of the generic EdDSA is thus not
   particularly useful for implementers.  For background and
   completeness, a succinct description of the generic EdDSA algorithm
   is given here.

   The definition of some parameters, such as n and c, may help to
   explain some steps of the algorithm that are not intuitive.

   This description closely follows [EDDSA2].

   EdDSA has 11 parameters:

   1.   An odd prime power p.  EdDSA uses an elliptic curve over the
        finite field GF(p).

   2.   An integer b with 2^(b-1) > p.  EdDSA public keys have exactly b
        bits, and EdDSA signatures have exactly 2*b bits.  b is
        recommended to be a multiple of 8, so public key and signature
        lengths are an integral number of octets.

   3.   A (b-1)-bit encoding of elements of the finite field GF(p).

   4.   A cryptographic hash function H producing 2*b-bit output.
        Conservative hash functions (i.e., hash functions where it is
        infeasible to create collisions) are recommended and do not have
        much impact on the total cost of EdDSA.

   5.   An integer c that is 2 or 3.  Secret EdDSA scalars are multiples
        of 2^c.  The integer c is the base-2 logarithm of the so-called
        cofactor.

   6.   An integer n with c <= n < b.  Secret EdDSA scalars have exactly
        n + 1 bits, with the top bit (the 2^n position) always set and
        the bottom c bits always cleared.

   7.   A non-square element d of GF(p).  The usual recommendation is to
        take it as the value nearest to zero that gives an acceptable
        curve.

   8.   A non-zero square element a of GF(p).  The usual recommendation
        for best performance is a = -1 if p mod 4 = 1, and a = 1 if
        p mod 4 = 3.

   9.   An element B != (0,1) of the set E = { (x,y) is a member of
        GF(p) x GF(p) such that a * x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d * x^2 * y^2 }.

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   10.  An odd prime L such that [L]B = 0 and 2^c * L = #E.  The number
        #E (the number of points on the curve) is part of the standard
        data provided for an elliptic curve E, or it can be computed as
        cofactor * order.

   11.  A "prehash" function PH.  PureEdDSA means EdDSA where PH is the
        identity function, i.e., PH(M) = M.  HashEdDSA means EdDSA where
        PH generates a short output, no matter how long the message is;
        for example, PH(M) = SHA-512(M).

   Points on the curve form a group under addition, (x3, y3) = (x1, y1)
   + (x2, y2), with the formulas

             x1 * y2 + x2 * y1                y1 * y2 - a * x1 * x2
   x3 = --------------------------,   y3 = ---------------------------
         1 + d * x1 * x2 * y1 * y2          1 - d * x1 * x2 * y1 * y2

   The neutral element in the group is (0,1).

   Unlike many other curves used for cryptographic applications, these
   formulas are "complete"; they are valid for all points on the curve,
   with no exceptions.  In particular, the denominators are non-zero for
   all input points.

   There are more efficient formulas, which are still complete, that use
   homogeneous coordinates to avoid the expensive modulo p inversions.
   See [Faster-ECC] and [Edwards-revisited].

3.1.  Encoding

   An integer 0 < S < L - 1 is encoded in little-endian form as a b-bit
   string ENC(S).

   An element (x,y) of E is encoded as a b-bit string called ENC(x,y),
   which is the (b-1)-bit encoding of y concatenated with one bit that
   is 1 if x is negative and 0 if x is not negative.

   The encoding of GF(p) is used to define "negative" elements of GF(p):
   specifically, x is negative if the (b-1)-bit encoding of x is
   lexicographically larger than the (b-1)-bit encoding of -x.

3.2.  Keys

   An EdDSA private key is a b-bit string k.  Let the hash H(k) =
   (h_0, h_1, ..., h_(2b-1)) determine an integer s, which is 2^n plus
   the sum of m = 2^i * h_i for all integer i, c <= i < n.  Let s
   determine the multiple A = [s]B.  The EdDSA public key is ENC(A).
   The bits h_b, ..., h_(2b-1) are used below during signing.

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


3.3.  Sign

   The EdDSA signature of a message M under a private key k is defined
   as the PureEdDSA signature of PH(M).  In other words, EdDSA simply
   uses PureEdDSA to sign PH(M).

   The PureEdDSA signature of a message M under a private key k is the
   2*b-bit string ENC(R) || ENC(S).  R and S are derived as follows.
   First define r = H(h_b || ... || h_(2b-1) || M) interpreting 2*b-bit
   strings in little-endian form as integers in {0, 1, ..., 2^(2*b) -
   1}.  Let R = [r]B and S = (r + H(ENC(R) || ENC(A) || PH(M)) * s) mod
   L.  The s used here is from the previous section.

3.4.  Verify

   To verify a PureEdDSA signature ENC(R) || ENC(S) on a message M under
   a public key ENC(A), proceed as follows.  Parse the inputs so that A
   and R are elements of E, and S is a member of the set {0, 1, ...,
   L-1}.  Compute h = H(ENC(R) || ENC(A) || M), and check the group
   equation [2^c * S] B = 2^c * R + [2^c * h] A in E.  The signature is
   rejected if parsing fails (including S being out of range) or if the
   group equation does not hold.

   EdDSA verification for a message M is defined as PureEdDSA
   verification for PH(M).

4.  PureEdDSA, HashEdDSA, and Naming

   One of the parameters of the EdDSA algorithm is the "prehash"
   function.  This may be the identity function, resulting in an
   algorithm called PureEdDSA, or a collision-resistant hash function
   such as SHA-512, resulting in an algorithm called HashEdDSA.

   Choosing which variant to use depends on which property is deemed to
   be more important between 1) collision resilience and 2) a single-
   pass interface for creating signatures.  The collision resilience
   property means EdDSA is secure even if it is feasible to compute
   collisions for the hash function.  The single-pass interface property
   means that only one pass over the input message is required to create
   a signature.  PureEdDSA requires two passes over the input.  Many
   existing APIs, protocols, and environments assume digital signature
   algorithms only need one pass over the input and may have API or
   bandwidth concerns supporting anything else.

   Note that single-pass verification is not possible with most uses of
   signatures, no matter which signature algorithm is chosen.  This is
   because most of the time, one can't process the message until the
   signature is validated, which needs a pass on the entire message.

   This document specifies parameters resulting in the HashEdDSA
   variants Ed25519ph and Ed448ph and the PureEdDSA variants Ed25519 and
   Ed448.

5.  EdDSA Instances

   This section instantiates the general EdDSA algorithm for the
   edwards25519 and edwards448 curves, each for the PureEdDSA and
   HashEdDSA variants (plus a contextualized extension of the Ed25519
   scheme).  Thus, five different parameter sets are described.

5.1.  Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519

   Ed25519 is EdDSA instantiated with:

   For Ed25519, dom2(f,c) is the empty string.  The phflag value is
   irrelevant.  The context (if present at all) MUST be empty.  This
   causes the scheme to be one and the same with the Ed25519 scheme
   published earlier.

   For Ed25519ctx, phflag=0.  The context input SHOULD NOT be empty.




Josefsson & Liusvaara         Informational                     [Page 9]

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   For Ed25519ph, phflag=1 and PH is SHA512 instead.  That is, the input
   is hashed using SHA-512 before signing with Ed25519.

   Value of context is set by the signer and verifier (maximum of 255
   octets; the default is empty string, except for Ed25519, which can't
   have context) and has to match octet by octet for verification to be
   successful.

   The curve used is equivalent to Curve25519 [CURVE25519], under a
   change of coordinates, which means that the difficulty of the
   discrete logarithm problem is the same as for Curve25519.

5.1.1.  Modular Arithmetic

   For advice on how to implement arithmetic modulo p = 2^255 - 19
   efficiently and securely, see Curve25519 [CURVE25519].  For inversion
   modulo p, it is recommended to use the identity x^-1 = x^(p-2) (mod
   p).  Inverting zero should never happen, as it would require invalid
   input, which would have been detected before, or would be a
   calculation error.

   For point decoding or "decompression", square roots modulo p are
   needed.  They can be computed using the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm or
   the special case for p = 5 (mod 8).  To find a square root of a,
   first compute the candidate root x = a^((p+3)/8) (mod p).  Then there
   are three cases:

      x^2 = a (mod p).  Then x is a square root.

      x^2 = -a (mod p).  Then 2^((p-1)/4) * x is a square root.

      a is not a square modulo p.

5.1.2.  Encoding

   All values are coded as octet strings, and integers are coded using
   little-endian convention, i.e., a 32-octet string h h[0],...h[31]
   represents the integer h[0] + 2^8 * h[1] + ... + 2^248 * h[31].

   A curve point (x,y), with coordinates in the range 0 <= x,y < p, is
   coded as follows.  First, encode the y-coordinate as a little-endian
   string of 32 octets.  The most significant bit of the final octet is
   always zero.  To form the encoding of the point, copy the least
   significant bit of the x-coordinate to the most significant bit of
   the final octet.

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


5.1.3.  Decoding

   Decoding a point, given as a 32-octet string, is a little more
   complicated.

   1.  First, interpret the string as an integer in little-endian
       representation.  Bit 255 of this number is the least significant
       bit of the x-coordinate and denote this value x_0.  The
       y-coordinate is recovered simply by clearing this bit.  If the
       resulting value is >= p, decoding fails.

   2.  To recover the x-coordinate, the curve equation implies
       x^2 = (y^2 - 1) / (d y^2 + 1) (mod p).  The denominator is always
       non-zero mod p.  Let u = y^2 - 1 and v = d y^2 + 1.  To compute
       the square root of (u/v), the first step is to compute the
       candidate root x = (u/v)^((p+3)/8).  This can be done with the
       following trick, using a single modular powering for both the
       inversion of v and the square root:

                          (p+3)/8      3        (p-5)/8
                 x = (u/v)        = u v  (u v^7)         (mod p)

   3.  Again, there are three cases:

       1.  If v x^2 = u (mod p), x is a square root.

       2.  If v x^2 = -u (mod p), set x <-- x * 2^((p-1)/4), which is a
           square root.

       3.  Otherwise, no square root exists for modulo p, and decoding
           fails.

   4.  Finally, use the x_0 bit to select the right square root.  If
       x = 0, and x_0 = 1, decoding fails.  Otherwise, if x_0 != x mod
       2, set x <-- p - x.  Return the decoded point (x,y).

5.1.4.  Point Addition

   For point addition, the following method is recommended.  A point
   (x,y) is represented in extended homogeneous coordinates (X, Y, Z,
   T), with x = X/Z, y = Y/Z, x * y = T/Z.

   The neutral point is (0,1), or equivalently in extended homogeneous
   coordinates (0, Z, Z, 0) for any non-zero Z.

   The following formulas for adding two points, (x3,y3) =
   (x1,y1)+(x2,y2), on twisted Edwards curves with a=-1, square a, and
   non-square d are described in Section 3.1 of [Edwards-revisited] and
   in [EFD-TWISTED-ADD].  They are complete, i.e., they work for any
   pair of valid input points.

                 A = (Y1-X1)*(Y2-X2)
                 B = (Y1+X1)*(Y2+X2)
                 C = T1*2*d*T2
                 D = Z1*2*Z2
                 E = B-A
                 F = D-C
                 G = D+C
                 H = B+A
                 X3 = E*F
                 Y3 = G*H
                 T3 = E*H
                 Z3 = F*G

   For point doubling, (x3,y3) = (x1,y1)+(x1,y1), one could just
   substitute equal points in the above (because of completeness, such
   substitution is valid) and observe that four multiplications turn
   into squares.  However, using the formulas described in Section 3.2
   of [Edwards-revisited] and in [EFD-TWISTED-DBL] saves a few smaller
   operations.

                 A = X1^2
                 B = Y1^2
                 C = 2*Z1^2
                 H = A+B
                 E = H-(X1+Y1)^2
                 G = A-B
                 F = C+G
                 X3 = E*F
                 Y3 = G*H
                 T3 = E*H
                 Z3 = F*G

5.1.5.  Key Generation

   The private key is 32 octets (256 bits, corresponding to b) of
   cryptographically secure random data.  See [RFC4086] for a discussion
   about randomness.

   The 32-byte public key is generated by the following steps.

   1.  Hash the 32-byte private key using SHA-512, storing the digest in
       a 64-octet large buffer, denoted h.  Only the lower 32 bytes are
       used for generating the public key.

   2.  Prune the buffer: The lowest three bits of the first octet are
       cleared, the highest bit of the last octet is cleared, and the
       second highest bit of the last octet is set.

   3.  Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming a
       secret scalar s.  Perform a fixed-base scalar multiplication
       [s]B.

   4.  The public key A is the encoding of the point [s]B.  First,
       encode the y-coordinate (in the range 0 <= y < p) as a little-
       endian string of 32 octets.  The most significant bit of the
       final octet is always zero.  To form the encoding of the point
       [s]B, copy the least significant bit of the x coordinate to the
       most significant bit of the final octet.  The result is the
       public key.

5.1.6.  Sign

   The inputs to the signing procedure is the private key, a 32-octet
   string, and a message M of arbitrary size.  For Ed25519ctx and
   Ed25519ph, there is additionally a context C of at most 255 octets
   and a flag F, 0 for Ed25519ctx and 1 for Ed25519ph.

   1.  Hash the private key, 32 octets, using SHA-512.  Let h denote the
       resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s from the first
       half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A, as
       described in the previous section.  Let prefix denote the second
       half of the hash digest, h[32],...,h[63].

   2.  Compute SHA-512(dom2(F, C) || prefix || PH(M)), where M is the
       message to be signed.  Interpret the 64-octet digest as a little-
       endian integer r.

   3.  Compute the point [r]B.  For efficiency, do this by first
       reducing r modulo L, the group order of B.  Let the string R be
       the encoding of this point.



Josefsson & Liusvaara         Informational                    [Page 13]

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   4.  Compute SHA512(dom2(F, C) || R || A || PH(M)), and interpret the
       64-octet digest as a little-endian integer k.

   5.  Compute S = (r + k * s) mod L.  For efficiency, again reduce k
       modulo L first.

   6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of R (32 octets) and the
       little-endian encoding of S (32 octets; the three most
       significant bits of the final octet are always zero).

5.1.7.  Verify

   1.  To verify a signature on a message M using public key A, with F
       being 0 for Ed25519ctx, 1 for Ed25519ph, and if Ed25519ctx or
       Ed25519ph is being used, C being the context, first split the
       signature into two 32-octet halves.  Decode the first half as a
       point R, and the second half as an integer S, in the range
       0 <= s < L.  Decode the public key A as point A'.  If any of the
       decodings fail (including S being out of range), the signature is
       invalid.

   2.  Compute SHA512(dom2(F, C) || R || A || PH(M)), and interpret the
       64-octet digest as a little-endian integer k.

   3.  Check the group equation [8][S]B = [8]R + [8][k]A'.  It's
       sufficient, but not required, to instead check [S]B = R + [k]A'.

5.2.1.  Modular Arithmetic

   For advice on how to implement arithmetic modulo p = 2^448 - 2^224 -
   1 efficiently and securely, see [ED448].  For inversion modulo p, it
   is recommended to use the identity x^-1 = x^(p-2) (mod p).  Inverting
   zero should never happen, as it would require invalid input, which
   would have been detected before, or would be a calculation error.

   For point decoding or "decompression", square roots modulo p are
   needed.  They can be computed by first computing candidate root
   x = a ^ (p+1)/4 (mod p) and then checking if x^2 = a.  If it is, then
   x is the square root of a; if it isn't, then a does not have a square
   root.

5.2.2.  Encoding

   All values are coded as octet strings, and integers are coded using
   little-endian convention, i.e., a 57-octet string h h[0],...h[56]
   represents the integer h[0] + 2^8 * h[1] + ... + 2^448 * h[56].

   A curve point (x,y), with coordinates in the range 0 <= x,y < p, is
   coded as follows.  First, encode the y-coordinate as a little-endian
   string of 57 octets.  The final octet is always zero.  To form the
   encoding of the point, copy the least significant bit of the
   x-coordinate to the most significant bit of the final octet.

5.2.3.  Decoding

   Decoding a point, given as a 57-octet string, is a little more
   complicated.

   1.  First, interpret the string as an integer in little-endian
       representation.  Bit 455 of this number is the least significant
       bit of the x-coordinate, and denote this value x_0.  The
       y-coordinate is recovered simply by clearing this bit.  If the
       resulting value is >= p, decoding fails.

   2.  To recover the x-coordinate, the curve equation implies
       x^2 = (y^2 - 1) / (d y^2 - 1) (mod p).  The denominator is always
       non-zero mod p.  Let u = y^2 - 1 and v = d y^2 - 1.  To compute
       the square root of (u/v), the first step is to compute the
       candidate root x = (u/v)^((p+1)/4).  This can be done using the
       following trick, to use a single modular powering for both the
       inversion of v and the square root:

                          (p+1)/4    3            (p-3)/4
                 x = (u/v)        = u  v (u^5 v^3)         (mod p)

   3.  If v * x^2 = u, the recovered x-coordinate is x.  Otherwise, no
       square root exists, and the decoding fails.

   4.  Finally, use the x_0 bit to select the right square root.  If
       x = 0, and x_0 = 1, decoding fails.  Otherwise, if x_0 != x mod
       2, set x <-- p - x.  Return the decoded point (x,y).

5.2.4.  Point Addition

   For point addition, the following method is recommended.  A point
   (x,y) is represented in projective coordinates (X, Y, Z), with
   x = X/Z, y = Y/Z.

   The neutral point is (0,1), or equivalently in projective coordinates
   (0, Z, Z) for any non-zero Z.

   The following formulas for adding two points, (x3,y3) =
   (x1,y1)+(x2,y2) on untwisted Edwards curve (i.e., a=1) with non-
   square d, are described in Section 4 of [Faster-ECC] and in
   [EFD-ADD].  They are complete, i.e., they work for any pair of valid
   input points.

                 A = Z1*Z2
                 B = A^2
                 C = X1*X2
                 D = Y1*Y2
                 E = d*C*D
                 F = B-E
                 G = B+E
                 H = (X1+Y1)*(X2+Y2)
                 X3 = A*F*(H-C-D)
                 Y3 = A*G*(D-C)
                 Z3 = F*G

   Again, similar to the other curve, doubling formulas can be obtained
   by substituting equal points, turning four multiplications into
   squares.  However, this is not even nearly optimal; the following
   formulas described in Section 4 of [Faster-ECC] and in [EFD-DBL] save
   multiple multiplications.

                 B = (X1+Y1)^2
                 C = X1^2
                 D = Y1^2
                 E = C+D
                 H = Z1^2
                 J = E-2*H
                 X3 = (B-E)*J
                 Y3 = E*(C-D)
                 Z3 = E*J

5.2.5.  Key Generation

   The private key is 57 octets (456 bits, corresponding to b) of
   cryptographically secure random data.  See [RFC4086] for a discussion
   about randomness.

   The 57-byte public key is generated by the following steps:

   1.  Hash the 57-byte private key using SHAKE256(x, 114), storing the
       digest in a 114-octet large buffer, denoted h.  Only the lower 57
       bytes are used for generating the public key.

   2.  Prune the buffer: The two least significant bits of the first
       octet are cleared, all eight bits the last octet are cleared, and
       the highest bit of the second to last octet is set.

   3.  Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming a
       secret scalar s.  Perform a known-base-point scalar
       multiplication [s]B.

   4.  The public key A is the encoding of the point [s]B.  First encode
       the y-coordinate (in the range 0 <= y < p) as a little-endian
       string of 57 octets.  The most significant bit of the final octet
       is always zero.  To form the encoding of the point [s]B, copy the
       least significant bit of the x coordinate to the most significant
       bit of the final octet.  The result is the public key.

5.2.6.  Sign

   The inputs to the signing procedure is the private key, a 57-octet
   string, a flag F, which is 0 for Ed448, 1 for Ed448ph, context C of
   at most 255 octets, and a message M of arbitrary size.

   1.  Hash the private key, 57 octets, using SHAKE256(x, 114).  Let h
       denote the resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s from
       the first half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A,
       as described in the previous section.  Let prefix denote the
       second half of the hash digest, h[57],...,h[113].

   2.  Compute SHAKE256(dom4(F, C) || prefix || PH(M), 114), where M is
       the message to be signed, F is 1 for Ed448ph, 0 for Ed448, and C
       is the context to use.  Interpret the 114-octet digest as a
       little-endian integer r.

   3.  Compute the point [r]B.  For efficiency, do this by first
       reducing r modulo L, the group order of B.  Let the string R be
       the encoding of this point.

   4.  Compute SHAKE256(dom4(F, C) || R || A || PH(M), 114), and
       interpret the 114-octet digest as a little-endian integer k.

   5.  Compute S = (r + k * s) mod L.  For efficiency, again reduce k
       modulo L first.

   6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of R (57 octets) and the
       little-endian encoding of S (57 octets; the ten most significant
       bits of the final octets are always zero).

5.2.7.  Verify

   1.  To verify a signature on a message M using context C and public
       key A, with F being 0 for Ed448 and 1 for Ed448ph, first split
       the signature into two 57-octet halves.  Decode the first half as
       a point R, and the second half as an integer S, in the range 0 <=
       s < L.  Decode the public key A as point A'.  If any of the
       decodings fail (including S being out of range), the signature is
       invalid.

   2.  Compute SHAKE256(dom4(F, C) || R || A || PH(M), 114), and
       interpret the 114-octet digest as a little-endian integer k.

   3.  Check the group equation [4][S]B = [4]R + [4][k]A'.  It's
       sufficient, but not required, to instead check [S]B = R + [k]A'.

6.  Ed25519 Python Illustration

   The rest of this section describes how Ed25519 can be implemented in
   Python (version 3.2 or later) for illustration.  See Appendix A for
   the complete implementation and Appendix B for a test-driver to run
   it through some test vectors.

   Note that this code is not intended for production as it is not
   proven to be correct for all inputs, nor does it protect against
   side-channel attacks.  The purpose is to illustrate the algorithm to
   help implementers with their own implementation.

## First, some preliminaries that will be needed.

    return hashlib.sha512(s).digest()

# Base field Z_p
p = 2**255 - 19

def modp_inv(x):

# Curve constant
d = -121665 * modp_inv(121666) % p

# Group order
q = 2**252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493

def sha512_modq(s):
    return int.from_bytes(sha512(s), "little") % q

## Then follows functions to perform point operations.

# Points are represented as tuples (X, Y, Z, T) of extended
# coordinates, with x = X/Z, y = Y/Z, x*y = T/Z

    C, D = 2 * P[3] * Q[3] * d % p, 2 * P[2] * Q[2] % p;
    E, F, G, H = B-A, D-C, D+C, B+A;
    return (E*F, G*H, F*G, E*H);

7.  Test Vectors

   This section contains test vectors for Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx,
   Ed448ph, Ed25519, and Ed448.

   Each section contains a sequence of test vectors.  The octets are hex
   encoded, and whitespace is inserted for readability.  Ed25519,
   Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519ph private and public keys are 32 octets;
   signatures are 64 octets.  Ed448 and Ed448ph private and public keys
   are 57 octets; signatures are 114 octets.  Messages are of arbitrary
   length.  If the context is non-empty, it is given as 1-255 octets.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Side-Channel Leaks

   For implementations performing signatures, secrecy of the private key
   is fundamental.  It is possible to protect against some side-channel
   attacks by ensuring that the implementation executes exactly the same
   sequence of instructions and performs exactly the same memory
   accesses, for any value of the private key.

   To make an implementation side-channel silent in this way, the modulo
   p arithmetic must not use any data-dependent branches, e.g., related
   to carry propagation.  Side-channel silent point addition is
   straightforward, thanks to the unified formulas.

   Scalar multiplication, multiplying a point by an integer, needs some
   additional effort to implement in a side-channel silent manner.  One
   simple approach is to implement a side-channel silent conditional
   assignment, and use it together with the binary algorithm to examine
   one bit of the integer at a time.

   Compared to other signature schemes, avoiding data-dependent branches
   is easier due to side-channel silent modulo p arithmetic being easier
   (with recommended curves) and having complete addition formulas
   instead of having a number of special cases.

   Note that the example implementations in this document do not attempt
   to be side-channel silent.

8.2.  Randomness Considerations

   EdDSA signatures are deterministic.  This protects against attacks
   arising from signing with bad randomness; the effects of which can,
   depending on the algorithm, range up to full private key compromise.
   It can be surprisingly hard to ensure good-quality random numbers,
   and there have been numerous security failures relating to this.

   Obviously, private key generation requires randomness, but due to the
   fact that the private key is hashed before use, a few missing bits of
   entropy doesn't constitute a disaster.

   The basic signature verification is also deterministic.  However,
   some speedups by verifying multiple signatures at once do require
   random numbers.

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


8.3.  Use of Contexts

   Contexts can be used to separate uses of the protocol between
   different protocols (which is very hard to reliably do otherwise) and
   between different uses within the same protocol.  However, the
   following SHOULD be kept in mind when using this facility:

      The context SHOULD be a constant string specified by the protocol
      using it.  It SHOULD NOT incorporate variable elements from the
      message itself.

      Contexts SHOULD NOT be used opportunistically, as that kind of use
      is very error prone.  If contexts are used, one SHOULD require all
      signature schemes available for use in that purpose support
      contexts.

      Contexts are an extra input, which percolate out of APIs; as such,
      even if the signature scheme supports contexts, those may not be
      available for use.  This problem is compounded by the fact that
      many times the application is not invoking the signing and
      verification functions directly but via some other protocol.

8.4.  Signature Malleability

   Some systems assume signatures are not malleable: that is, given a
   valid signature for some message under some key, the attacker can't
   produce another valid signature for the same message and key.

   Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are not malleable due to the
   verification check that decoded S is smaller than l.  Without this
   check, one can add a multiple of l into a scalar part and still pass
   signature verification, resulting in malleable signatures.

8.5.  Choice of Signature Primitive

   Ed25519 and Ed25519ph have a nominal strength of 128 bits, whereas
   Ed448 and Ed448ph have the strength of 224.  While the lower strength
   is sufficient for the foreseeable future, the higher level brings
   some defense against possible future cryptographic advances.  Both
   are demolished by quantum computers just about the same.

   The Ed25519ph and Ed448ph variants are prehashed.  This is mainly
   useful for interoperation with legacy APIs, since in most of the
   cases, either the amount of data signed is not large or the protocol
   is in the position to do digesting in ways better than just
   prehashing (e.g., tree hashing or splitting the data).  The





Josefsson & Liusvaara         Informational                    [Page 41]

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   prehashing also makes the functions greatly more vulnerable to
   weaknesses in hash functions used.  These variants SHOULD NOT be
   used.

   Ed25519ctx and Ed448 have contexts.  However, this is balanced by the
   problems noted in Section 8.3 about contexts.

   On the implementation front, Ed25519 is widely implemented and has
   many high-quality implementations.  The others have much worse
   support.

   In summary, if a high 128-bit security level is enough, use of
   Ed25519 is RECOMMENDED; otherwise, Ed448 is RECOMMENDED.

8.6.  Mixing Different Prehashes

   The schemes described in this document are designed to be resistant
   to mixing prehashes.  That is, it is infeasible to find a message
   that verifies using the same signature under another scheme, even if
   the original signed message was chosen.  Thus, one can use the same
   key pair for Ed25519, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519ph and correspondingly
   with Ed448 and Ed448ph.

   The "SigEd25519 no Ed25519 collisions" constant is chosen to be a
   textual string such that it does not decode as a point.  Because the
   inner hash input in the Ed25519 signature always starts with a valid
   point, there is no way trivial collision can be constructed.  In the
   case of seed hash, trivial collisions are so unlikely, even with an
   attacker choosing all inputs, that it is much more probable that
   something else goes catastrophically wrong.

8.7.  Signing Large Amounts of Data at Once

   Avoid signing large amounts of data at once (where "large" depends on
   the expected verifier).  In particular, unless the underlying
   protocol does not require it, the receiver MUST buffer the entire
   message (or enough information to reconstruct it, e.g., compressed or
   encrypted version) to be verified.

   This is needed because most of the time, it is unsafe to process
   unverified data, and verifying the signature makes a pass through the
   whole message, causing ultimately at least two passes through.

   As an API consideration, this means that any Initialize Update
   Finalize (IFU) verification interface is prone to misuse.






Josefsson & Liusvaara         Informational                    [Page 42]

RFC 8032                EdDSA: Ed25519 and Ed448            January 2017


   It is a bad idea to modify Ed25519 or Ed448 signing to be able to
   create valid Ed25519/Ed448 signatures using an IUF interface with
   only constant buffering.  Pretty much any error in such would cause
   catastrophic security failure.

8.8.  Multiplication by Cofactor in Verification

   The given verification formulas for both Ed25519 and Ed448 multiply
   points by the cofactor.  While this is not strictly necessary for
   security (in fact, any signature that meets the non-multiplied
   equation will satisfy the multiplied one), in some applications it is
   undesirable for implementations to disagree about the exact set of
   valid signatures.  Such disagreements could open up, e.g.,
   fingerprinting attacks.

8.9.  Use of SHAKE256 as a Hash Function

   Ed448 uses SHAKE256 as a hash function, even if SHAKE256 is
   specifically defined not to be a hash function.

   The first potentially troublesome property is that shorter outputs
   are prefixes of longer ones.  This is acceptable because output
   lengths are fixed.

   The second potentially troublesome property is failing to meet
   standard hash security notions (especially with preimages).  However,
   the estimated 256-bit security level against collisions and preimages
   is sufficient to pair with a 224-bit level elliptic curve.

Acknowledgements

   EdDSA and Ed25519 were initially described in a paper due to Daniel
   J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, and Bo-Yin
   Yang.  The Ed448 curve is due to Mike Hamburg.

   An earlier draft version of this document was coauthored by Niels
   Moeller.

   Feedback on this document was received from Werner Koch, Damien
   Miller, Bob Bradley, Franck Rondepierre, Alexey Melnikov, Kenny
   Paterson, and Robert Edmonds.

   The Ed25519 test vectors were double checked by Bob Bradley using
   three separate implementations (one based on TweetNaCl and two
   different implementations based on code from SUPERCOP).
